                            <p>I really think people living in west are spoiled and they really need to learn how to reuse and recycle than buying things that are use and throw. I have to admit, even though I am conscious about recycling and reusing, I have a long way to go to be anywhere near these housewives. I am going to remember from now on that not everything is destined for the rubbish bin. I need to think before I throw. </p>
                            <p>
                              No matter how rich or how poor people are, most Nepali people reuse lots of thing and this is what I observe.
